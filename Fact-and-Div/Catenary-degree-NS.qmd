## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the catenary degree of $S$, denoted by $\mathbf{C}(S)$, as

$$
\mathbf{C}(s) = \sup \{\mathbf{C}(s) ~ | ~ s \in S\},
$$

where $\mathbf{C}(s)$ denotes the [catenary degree of s](Catenary-degree-of-an-element.qmd) in $S$. If $Betti(S)$ denotes the set of [Betti elements](../Presentations-NS/Betti-element.qmd) of $S$, it can be proven that

$$
\mathbf{C}(S) = \max \{\mathbf{C}(b) ~ | ~ b \in Betti(S)\}.
$$

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, there is a relation between its [Delta set](Delta-set-NS.qmd) $\Delta(S)$, its catenary degree $\mathbf{C}(S)$, its [w-primality](w-primality-NS.qmd) $\omega(S)$ and its [tame degree](Tame-degree-NS.qmd) $\mathbf{t}(S)$, which is

$$
\max \Delta(S) + 2 \le \mathbf{C}(S) \le \omega(S) \le \mathbf{t}(S).
$$

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 5, 7, 9 \rangle$. The set of Betti elements of $S$ is $Betti(S) = \{14, 25, 27\}$, and if we compute the catenary degree of each element, it is obtained that $\mathbf{C}(14) = 2, \mathbf{C}(25) = 5$ and $\mathbf{C}(27) = 5$, then $\mathbf{C}(S) = \max \{2, 5, 5\} = 5$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 37, 42, 45, 80 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(37, 42, 45, 80);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the functions `CatenaryDegree` and `CatenaryDegreeOfNumericalSemigroup` return the catenary degree of $S$.

``` gap
gap> CatenaryDegree(S);
8
gap> CatenaryDegreeOfNumericalSemigroup(S) = CatenaryDegree(S);
true
```

If we also give an element $n$ of the numerical semigroup in `CatenaryDegree`, the function returns the catenary degree of $n$ in $S$.

``` gap
gap> CatenaryDegree(S, 400);
6
gap> CatenaryDegree(400, S);
6
```
