## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd), let $s, s' \in S$ and $\le_S$ the [relation order](../Basic-concepts/Relation-order-NS.qmd) of $S$. It is said that $s$ divides $s'$ if $s \le_S s'$. Equivalently, $s$ divides $s'$ if $s' \in s + S = \{s + x ~ | ~ x \in S\}$. The set of elements $s$ that divides $s'$ is the [set of divisors](../Basic-concepts/Set-divisors.qmd) of $s'$ in $S$ and it is denoted by $D(s')$.

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 3, 7, 11 \rangle = \{0, 3, 6, 7, 9, \rightarrow \}$ and $s' = 12$, let us compute the elements that divides $s'$. If $s \in S$ divides $s'$, then $s \le s'$, therefore the candidates are $\{0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12\}$ and the set of divisors is

$$
D(s') = \{0, 3, 6, 9, 12\}.
$$

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 21, 28, 32, 46 \rangle$, in GAP:

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(21, 28, 32, 46);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$ and an element $n$ of it, the function `DivisorsOfElementInNumericalSemigroup` computes the set of divisors of $n$ in $S$.

``` gap
gap> DivisorsOfElementInNumericalSemigroup(S,210);
[ 0, 21, 28, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147,
  154, 161, 168, 182, 189, 210 ]
gap> DivisorsOfElementInNumericalSemigroup(210, S);
[ 0, 21, 28, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, 133, 140, 147,
  154, 161, 168, 182, 189, 210 ]
```
