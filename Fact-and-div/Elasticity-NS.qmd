## Definition

Let $S$ be a [numerical semigroup](../Basic-concepts/Numerical-semigroup.qmd). It is defined the elasticity of $S$, denoted by $\rho(S)$, as

$$
\rho(S) = \sup \{\rho(s) ~ | ~ s \in S\},
$$

where $\rho(s)$ denotes the [elasticity of s](Elasticity-of-an-element.qmd) in $S$. If $S$ is [minimally generated](../Basic-concepts/Minimal-set-of-generators.qmd) by $\{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_p\}$ with $n_1 < n_2 < \cdots < n_p$, it can be proven that

$$
\rho(S) = \frac{n_p}{n_1}.
$$

## Examples

$\circ$ Let $S = \langle 17, 42, 89, 104 \rangle$. As $B = \{17, 42, 89, 104\}$ is a minimal set of generators, the elasticity of $S$ is $\rho(S) = 104/17$. If we take $s = 17 \cdot 104$, we have

$$
17 \cdot 104 = 104 \cdot 17 + 0 \cdot 42 + 0 \cdot 89 + 0 \cdot 104 = 0 \cdot 17 + 0 \cdot 42 + 0 \cdot 89 + 17 \cdot 104.
$$

Then, $(104,0,0,0)$ and $(0,0,0,17)$ are factorizations of $17 \cdot 104$ in $S$ with lengths $104$ and $17$, respectively. Therefore,

$$
\frac{104}{17} \le \rho(17 \cdot 104) \le \rho(S) = \frac{104}{17}.
$$

In conclusion, $\rho(17 \cdot 104) = 104/17$ and the elasticity of $S$ is reached by $s = 17 \cdot 104$.

## Examples with GAP

The following example is made with the package NumericalSgps in GAP.

$\diamond$ Let $S = \langle 18, 43, 92, 105 \rangle$, in GAP;

``` gap
gap> S := NumericalSemigroup(18, 43, 92, 105);
<Numerical semigroup with 4 generators>
```

Given a numerical semigroup $S$, the functions `Elasticity` and `ElasticityOfNumericalSemigroup` return the elasticity of $S$. In the function `Elasticity`, if we also give an element $n \in S$, the function returns the elasticity of $n$ in $S$.

``` gap
gap> Elasticity(S);
35/6
gap> Elasticity(S) = ElasticityOfNumericalSemigroup(S);
true
gap> Elasticity(S, 415);
6/5
gap> Elasticity(S, 1890);
35/6
```
